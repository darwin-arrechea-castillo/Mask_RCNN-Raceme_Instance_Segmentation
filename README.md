This is a customized implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 or ResNet101 backbone. 

This project detects and count the total amount of racemes in tropical forages (Urochloa spp.) throught an web or a desktop based application



The code is documented and designed to be easy to be implemented.
